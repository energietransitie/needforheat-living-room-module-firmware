# Installation

Follow all steps below before you continue in the NeedForHeat app.
## 1. Attach the sensor to the main module

In the box you received, the CO2L sensor is not yet attached to the main module. Click the sensor with the black pins onto the gray bar at the back of the main module. Ensure that the air holes of the sensor are free (the sensor should be sticking upward, as shown in the photo above).

## 2. Place at a suitable spot in the living room module

Find a suitable spot in the main living room:
- out of the sun;
- out of draft;
- near the thermostat;
- in reach of your home Wi-Fi network;
- within reach of a free electrical outlet.

Place the living room module there.
## 3. Plug in the power cord.

Make sure the USB cord is connected to the power adapter and to the device. Plug the power cord into the power outlet.

## 4. Connect the device with your home Wi-Fi.
